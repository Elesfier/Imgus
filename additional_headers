\section{Nagłówek plików PNG}
Jest to krótkie omówienie nagłówka plików z rozszerzeniem .png

\subsection{Podpis pliku}
Plik PNG się zaczyna z 8-bajtowym podpisem - Magic Number.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries 89} - Has the high bit set to detect transmission systems that do not support 8 bit data and to reduce the chance that a text file is mistakenly interpreted as a PNG, or vice versa.
\item {\bfseries 50 4E 47} - In ASCII, the letters PNG, allowing a person to identify the format easily if it is viewed in a text editor.
\item {\bfseries 0D 0A} - A DOS-style line ending (CRLF) to detect DOS-Unix line ending conversion of the data.
\item {\bfseries 1A} - A byte that stops display of the file under DOS when the command type has been used—the end-of-file character.
\item {\bfseries 0A} - A Unix-style line ending (LF) to detect Unix-DOS line ending conversion.
\end{itemize}

After the header comes a series of chunks, each of which conveys certain information about the image. Chunks declare themselves as critical or ancillary, and a program encountering an ancillary chunk that it does not understand can safely ignore it.

\subsection{Critical chunks}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries IHDR} - must be the first chunk; it contains (in this order) the image's width, height, bit depth, color type, compression method, filter method, and interlace method (13 data bytes total).
\item {\bfseries PLTE} - contains the palette; list of colors.
\item {\bfseries IDAT} - contains the image, which may be split among multiple IDAT chunks. Such splitting increases filesize slightly, but makes it possible to generate a PNG in a streaming manner. The IDAT chunk contains the actual image data, which is the output stream of the compression algorithm.
\item {\bfseries IEND} - marks the image end.
The PLTE chunk is essential for color type 3 (indexed color). It is optional for color types 2 and 6 (truecolor and truecolor with alpha) and it must not appear for color types 0 and 4 (grayscale and grayscale with alpha).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ancillary chunks}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries bKGD} - gives the default background color. It is intended for use when there is no better choice available, such as in standalone image viewers (but not web browsers; see below for more details).
\item {\bfseries cHRM} - gives the chromaticity coordinates of the display primaries and white point.
\item {\bfseries gAMA} - specifies gamma.
\item {\bfseries hIST} - can store the histogram, or total amount of each color in the image.
\item {\bfseries iCCP} - is an ICC color profile.
\item {\bfseries iTXt} - contains UTF-8 text, compressed or not, with an optional language tag. iTXt chunk with the keyword 'XML:com.adobe.xmp' can contain Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP).
\item {\bfseries pHYs} - holds the intended pixel size and/or aspect ratio of the image.
\item {\bfseries sBIT} - (significant bits) indicates the color-accuracy of the source data.
\item {\bfseries sPLT} - suggests a palette to use if the full range of colors is unavailable.
\item {\bfseries sRGB} - indicates that the standard sRGB color space is used.
\item {\bfseries sTER} - stereo-image indicator chunk for stereoscopic images.
\item {\bfseries tEXt} - can store text that can be represented in ISO/IEC 8859-1, with one key-value pair for each chunk. The "key" must be between 1 and 79 characters long. Separator is a null character. The "value" can be any length, including zero up to the maximum permissible chunk size minus the length of the keyword and separator. Neither "key" nor "value" can contain null character. Leading or trailing spaces are also disallowed.
\item {\bfseries tIME} - stores the time that the image was last changed.
\item {\bfseries tRNS} - contains transparency information. For indexed images, it stores alpha channel values for one or more palette entries. For truecolor and grayscale images, it stores a single pixel value that is to be regarded as fully transparent.
\item {\bfseries zTXt} - contains compressed text with the same limits as tEXt.
The lowercase first letter in these chunks indicates that they are not needed for the PNG specification. The lowercase last letter in some chunks indicates that they are safe to copy, even if the application concerned does not
